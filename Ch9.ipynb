    "## 9. CLASSES\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is one of the\n",
    "most effective approaches to writing software. In object-oriented programming you\n",
    "write classes that represent real-world things\n",
    "and situations, and you create objects based on these\n",
    "classes.  \n",
    "When you create individual objects from the class, each object is automatically equipped with the general behavior; you can then give each object\n",
    "whatever unique traits you desire.  \n",
    "Making an object from a class is called instantiation, and you work with\n",
    "instances of a class.  \n",
    "#### Creating and Using a Class:\n",
    "You can model almost anything using classes with it's behavior which are usual functions known as methods,by:  \n",
    "class Class_Name:  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; def .....    \n",
    "Let us see it in detail.\n",
    "#### Making an Instance from a Class:  \n",
    "Think of a class as a set of instructions for how to make an instance. The\n",
    "class Person is a set of instructions that tells Python how to make individual\n",
    "instances representing specific person.\n",
    "#### Accessing Attributes:\n",
    "To access the attributes of an instance, you use dot notation.\n",
    "#### Calling Methods:\n",
    "After we create an instance from the class Person, we can use dot notation to\n",
    "call any method defined in Person.\n",
    "#### Creating Multiple Instances:\n",
    "You can create as many instances from a class as you need."
